# Compressor.js

#### 13th March 2024 by Divyank Shah

## Why Compressor.js?

[Compressor.js](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/compressorjs) is a client side image compression package that utilizes native browser APIs to create a **lossy**
and **asynchronous** compression system. This compression can be applied before systems upload images to external datastore.

Hackathon website was originally introduced in Cutiehack 2023 without Compressor.js. When judges would sign up, they were required to
upload a headshot that would later get put on the primary site. To ensure Firebase standards and general image compression, we required
users to upload images less than 1 MB, since this was a limit by Firebase. Firebase would only allow a maximum of 1MB being put into a document
at any given time.

If the user did not meet these requirements, then error messages would show up indicating the user uploaded an image too large. However,
there was a small oversight, where images with sizes in the 800 KB - 1 MB range would be rejected since it did not consider the other metdata
the form collected such as name, email, gender, shirt size, title and more.

Judges expressed frustration as the system would not work despite their images being in the "expected" range. In addition, images were stored
with a larger size than necessry which eventually would slow down network response times when pulling judge information on the admin portal. In addition,
if users did not initally have an image in the expected range, then the user would be responsible for manually compressing the image.

## Implementing Compression

```js title="src/utils/convert.js"
export const compress = (file) => {
  if (file.type.split("/")[0] !== "image") return file;

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    new Compressor(file, {
      quality: 0.8,
      maxWidth: 800,
      maxHeight: 800,
      success(result) {
        resolve(result);
      },
      error(err) {
        reject(err);
      },
    });
  });
};
```

The function above is applied whenever a user uploads any sort of file. If the file is an image then compression is run otherwise the file
is returned. For example, if the user uploads a PDF, then the PDF will not be compressed. The compression configuration is simple in that
the goal is to maintain at least 80% of the quality and shrink the size to within a 800 pixels x 800 pixels square.

## Aftermath

With Compressor.js, the user experience is simplified. With client side image compression, the image is first compressed upon a file upload and then checked
the compressed image falls under the expected range. As a result, there were 2 main benefits: better judge experience and smaller network responses.

Compressor.js was implemented right after Cutiehack 2023 and Rosehack 2024 was able to benefit from this upgrade. As a result, judges did not face many difficulties
filling out the form and uploading a headshot. In addition, the admin portals were also getting smaller responses due to the smaller images.
