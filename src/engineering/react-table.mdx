# React Table

#### 17th April 2024 by Raidah Fairooz

[React Table](https://tanstack.com/table/v7/) is an headless UI library within the [Tanstack](https://tanstack.com) framework, used to build interactive complex tables for large scale data while providing the developer full control over the designs. This aligns with the main idea of Headless UI which allows for customized styles but maintains the core functionalities.

## Tables in Hackathon Website

In order to facilitate event and registration management, we created an admin portal to virtually centralize all hackathon operations. This portal has multiple pages with separate interactive data grids/dashboards displaying key information for participants, judges, volunteers etc in a tabular format. The admin members also have access to a toolbar to edit the table.

## Initial Approach and Challenges

As mentioned, each page in the admin portal needs its unique requirements for the dashboard. We created reusable and editable components like Filter, Toolbar etc to pass into `Dashboard.js` below. This serves the initial purpose but introduces several problems. The states are managed within each dashboard causing duplicate code across pages which also leads to complicated maintenance and tedious bug fixing.

```
const Dashboard = ({
   title,
   page,
   empty,
   dropdown,
   filter,
   header,
   statuses,
   tags,
 }) => {
   const [input, setInput] = useState({
     input: "",
   });
   const [filters, setFilters] = useState(filter);
   const [headers, setHeaders] = useState(header);
   const [objects, setObjects] = useState(null);
   return (
     <div> ...
     </div>
   );
 };
```

## The Solution - React Table

The library provides lightweight fully customizable hooks that can swiftly implement filtering, sorting, pagination, searching etc. Besides being able to customize UI, there are several helper functions like `getHeaderGroups()`, `getRowModel()` etc to access the already formatted data. In order to update the table based on its current state and user actions, we can easily use callback functions.

```
const Table = ({
  getHeaderGroups,
  getRowModel,
  Dropdown,
  empty,
  loading,
  meta,
  searchParams,
  page,
}) => {
  const index = parseInt(searchParams.index ?? 1);
  const size = parseInt(searchParams.size ?? 10);

  const { first, last, total } = meta;

  return (
    <>
      <div className="bg-white h-[75vh] overflow-y-scroll flex flex-col justify-between">
        <div className="h-full">
          <div className="text-white bg-hackathon-blue-200 rounded-t-lg">
            {getHeaderGroups().map(({ headers, id }) => (
              <div key={id} className="flex items-center px-3 py-2">
                {headers.map(({ id, column, getContext }) => (
                  <div
                    key={id}
                    className={`${column.columnDef.width} flex items-center`}
                    data-cy="header"
                  >
                    {flexRender(column.columnDef.header, getContext())}
                    {column.getCanSort() && (
                      <FaArrowRightArrowLeft
                        className={`mx-2 rotate-90 hover:cursor-pointer hover:opacity-50 text-hackathon-gray-200 ${
                          column.getIsSorted() && "hidden"
                        }`}
                        data-cy={`${column.id}-sorting`}
                        onClick={column.getToggleSortingHandler()}
                      />
                    )}
                    {column.getIsSorted() === "asc" && (
                      <FaSortAlphaDown
                        onClick={column.getToggleSortingHandler()}
                        data-cy={`${column.id}-sorting-desc`}
                        className="mx-2 hover:cursor-pointer hover:opacity-50 text-white"
                      />
                    )}
                    {column.getIsSorted() === "desc" && (
                      <FaSortAlphaUp
                        onClick={column.getToggleSortingHandler()}
                        data-cy={`${column.columnDef.header}-sorting-asc`}
                        className="mx-2 hover:cursor-pointer hover:opacity-50 text-white"
                      />
                    )}
                  </div>
                ))}
              </div>
            ))}
          </div>
```

To build out the table, we create separate column data files which specifies headers, cells and accessor keys corresponding to columns of each row/item. This ensures code consistency. The cells' styles can also be customized based on the data we receive like the `Tag` component.

```
export const generateAffiliation = (affiliations) => ({
  accessorKey: "affiliation",
  header: "Affiliation",
  width: "w-1/12",
  cell: ({ getValue }) => (
    <Tag text={affiliations[getValue()]} color={COLORS[getValue()]} />
  ),
});
```

```
export const COLUMNS = [
  generateSelect(),
  {
    accessorKey: "name",
    header: "Name",
    width: "w-3/12",
    enableColumnFilter: true,
    filterFn: "includesString",
    searchable: true,
    cell: ({ getValue }) => <div>{getValue()}</div>,
  },
```

## Benefits

In terms of UI, the dashboard now has a much cleaner look and new added features like pagination. By migrating to react table, we achieved significant improvement in performance due to ~40% reduction in lines of code and faster loading times.
